# MapApp V10 - Right Panel Implementation

## âœ¨ Overview
The right panel is now a Pico-first, React component that pairs with the Cesium globe. It keeps the experience lightweightâ€”no carousels or extra dependenciesâ€”while still delivering a rich, glowy card treatment for every project.

## ðŸŽ¨ Core Features
- **Search + Filters** â€“ Instant text search across project name, leads, and location plus category/theme dropdowns.
- **Narrative-aware feed** â€“ During the cosmic intro we hide or spotlight specific projects; once the journey begins, the full dataset appears.
- **Native momentum scroll** â€“ Custom pointer drag + inertia keeps scrolling buttery without third-party libraries.
- **Inline detail view** â€“ Clicking a card expands it in place with hero media, metadata, themes, and badges.
- **Pico-compliant styling** â€“ All typography, spacing, and controls inherit Pico tokens with a few tasteful overrides.

## ðŸ§  Component Flow
1. Props arrive (`projects`, `onSelectProject`, `narrativeIndex`).
2. We derive unique categories/themes for the dropdowns.
3. `filteredProjects` memoizes narrative gating + search/filter logic.
4. A pointer handler adds drag-to-scroll with gentle momentum.
5. Cards render; selecting one both expands the detail view and notifies the parent so the globe can fly to it.

## ðŸ”Œ Props
```js
<MapApp.RightPanel
  projects={projectsArray}
  onSelectProject={handleSelect}
  narrativeIndex={narrativeStep}
/>
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Future Enhancements
1. Highlight active card when the globe selects a project externally.
2. Sync hash routing so `/#project/:id` opens the detail view automatically.
3. Surface media galleries when `Artworks`/`Music` arrays have assets.
4. Add quick-share buttons (copy link, email) inside the detail view.

## ðŸŽ› Styling Notes
- Tweak `--pico-primary` or `--sidebar-width` in `styles/theme.css` to change the palette/layout globally.
- Card/Detail specifics live in `styles/rightpanel.css`; keep overrides minimal to stay on-brand.
- Responsive stacking is handled via CSS grid in `theme.css` with breakpoints at 1024px and 768px.

Enjoy the streamlined, dependency-free browsing experience! ðŸš€
