Optimization & Cleanup Backlog
===============================

Deprecated / Buggy Logic
- [x] components/GlobeContainer.js:905 – Intro progress dots still reference `setNarrativeIndex`, which no longer exists. Wire the click handler through the `onNarrativeChange` prop instead.

Unused Assets & Utilities
- [x] index.html:32-34 – Remove the three Embla Carousel scripts; the app never calls Embla, so these CDNs only add startup cost.
- [x] utils/accessibility.js:19 – File exports helpers that nothing invokes. Either hook them up to components or delete the module to avoid the “TODO” noise.

Dead State / Refs
- [x] components/GlobeContainer.js:171 – `clockViewModelRef` is never read after assignment.
- [x] components/GlobeContainer.js:180 – `globeQualityRef` is likewise unused.

Performance Opportunities
- [x] components/GlobeContainer.js:532, components/GlobeContainer.js:680 – Marker rebuild currently nukes all Cesium entities and kicks off one `setTimeout` per marker. Diff the project list and cancel pending timers during cleanup.
- [x] components/GlobeContainer.js:123 – `updateMarkerGraphics` regenerates SVG + base64 images on every selection change. Cache per-project (or per-color) marker imagery.
- [x] components/GlobeContainer.js:728 – Quality changes trigger a full `window.location.reload()`. Apply the selected preset to the live viewer so state survives.
- [x] styles/globe.css:55, styles/globe.css:410, styles/narrative-bar.css:77 – Heavy blur/backdrop-filter usage. Detect `MapAppPerf.isLowPower` or `prefers-reduced-motion` and fall back to solid fills.
- [x] components/RightPanel.js:31, components/RightPanel.js:57, components/RightPanel.js:342 – Theme tags are repeatedly split/joined. Precompute a normalized tag array when data loads (or memoize per project) to speed up filtering.

Suggested Order of Attack
1. Fix intro dot handler and strip unused refs/scripts (quick wins, eliminates console noise).
2. Prune unused accessibility stub or wire it up.
3. Optimize marker pipeline (diff + cache); verify performance on low-end hardware.
4. Tweak visual effects and tag indexing based on perf flags.
