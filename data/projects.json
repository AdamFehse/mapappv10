My future work will include an analysis of the diverse economies and economies\nof care found within prisoner social organizations, as well as an application of a\ngeographical theory called ‚Äúflat ontology,‚Äù that moves away from spatial thinking reliant\non scale, emphasizing instead the relational and contextual nature of all human\ninteractions. I am grateful for the opportunity to be a part of this research community, the\nsupport of the Confluence Center has been invaluable to my graduate education."

Students often commented that this was their favorite part of the class‚Äîcomposing their very own poetic corridos and inditas. Each one used their poetic voice through the text and, in many cases, through composing their own music. We even had a few performers sing their ballads while playing the guitar! They grappled with the complexities surrounding language, identity, and borderlands landscapes that they called home. Overall, the corridos and inditas worked as a form of poetic and musical testimonio for students. Overall, I am grateful for the opportunity to have worked as a Fronteridades fellow as it has enabled me to form a foundational base for my research. Future projects include developing the work into a peer-reviewed article with an expressive culture and/or folklore Journal such as the Journal of Folklore Research. Thank you to everyone at the Confluencenter for your support and for making this project possible!"
