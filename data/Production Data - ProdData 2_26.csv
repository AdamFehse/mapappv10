She included two individuals wearing red clothing, symbolizing freedom of movement, as they no longer needed ropa de camuflaje (camouflage clothing), to avoid detection.

The area where the border once stood was depicted with homes, trees, mountains, buildings, automobiles, a blue sky, and the sun, illustrating a vibrant and peaceful environment. She explained that the individuals wore red clothing to signify their newfound freedom. She mentioned that this activity prompted her to reflect on her journey to the shelter and how imagining a world without borders provided her alivio psicológico (psychological relief). This highlights the healing value of creative expression in processing emotions and experiences related to migration. She also expressed compassion for others worldwide who are separated due to physical barriers. This reflects an understanding of the interconnection of migration issues globally, as many migrants have referred to others as nuestra familia migrante (our migrant family)."",

Her poem claims independence, empowerment, and a commitment to defining one's own life and happiness, regardless of social norms. She shared this thought before creating the poem: “Respeto al tiempo y paciencia de mi acimiento para la que esperaron poder llamarme Kimberlyn y mi identidad está en mí y no en mi nombre.” [I respect the time and patience of my birth for which they waited so they could name me Kimberlyn and my identity is in me and not my name]."",

Ph.D. in Spanish with a concentration in Border Studies from the University of Arizona in 2023.
She was a 2021 Mellon-Fronteridades Graduate Fellow and a 2023 American Association of

recovering omitted histories of the U.S.-Mexico borderlands through archival research and
utilizing such narratives as pedagogical tools in the Spanish as a Heritage Language (SHL)
Classroom. Work was carried out in collaboration with Senior Archivists of the Center for
Southwest Research and the State Records and Archives of New Mexico. The project evolved to
center feminine-voiced oral narratives in the form corridos and inditas to be utilized in the SHL
classroom. A digital story was created which navigated students through the validation of
borderlands history, language, and culture while challenging dominant transnational narratives—
those that divide and create an “us” versus “them” perspective of the borderlands. Students were
tasked with recovering cultural expressions within their community or from popular culture
which had the same objective. Then, students composed their own ballads while centering
transnational and borderlands experiences. This multimodal project included images, text, and
audio after and offered students the opportunity to delve into the poetic form of the corrido and
indita while also offering a creative and expressive outlet.

Students often commented that this was their favorite part of the class—composing their very own poetic corridos and inditas. Each one used their poetic voice through the text and, in many cases, through composing their own music. We even had a few performers sing their ballads while playing the guitar! They grappled with the complexities surrounding language, identity, and borderlands landscapes that they called home. Overall, the corridos and inditas worked as a form of poetic and musical testimonio for students. Overall, I am grateful for the opportunity to have worked as a Fronteridades fellow as it has enabled me to form a foundational base for my research. Future projects include developing the work into a peer-reviewed article with an expressive culture and/or folklore Journal such as the Journal of Folklore Research.
